Whitelist for friendly Opponents

"Mining, Drinking and Fighting - he does it all"

Reduce combat chase range, especially on small maps.

Prevent dead loops by adding up the past X number of fields visited and use that as a negative bias.

When chasing an opponent that is one field ahead always have 20hp to spare as he could turn around and get the first hit.
Now, if we can get the first hit. (make only one move and deal dmg) then we could have 20hp less and still win.
